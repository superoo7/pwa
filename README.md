# Progressive Web App (PWA)
My notes on PWA. 

Tools that I might use :-
* Webpack
* Gulp
* Material Design
* JS
* EcmaScript6
* React/JSX
* Polymer 2.0

## What feature of PWA?
* Reliable
* Fast
* Engaging

## Some stats
- on 2015, user spends 87% of time on native app and 13% on web app (source: comScore)
- user spend 80% of their time on top 3 used app on their phone
- Web has 2.5x reach of app

## Why traditional web does not overcome issue of user not using web app
* Push notification in native app pulls user back 
* Easier to start the app with native
* Access native device feature like camera
* Work Offline 

## Why not native app?
* Learn 2 languages
* Need multiple developer
* HTML, CSS, JS
* average installed app in phone is 0

## Quick start with PWA
use of service worker `navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js');`
